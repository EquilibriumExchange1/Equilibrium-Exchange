# ðŸ“Š Harvest lock

A farm bounty blocking tool that helps to control the limit and frequency of harvests in order to prevent farm arbitrage bots from continuously harvesting and dumping.

To understand better, we will use the following example:

The harvest of the EMX -BUSD pair is 12 hours. That is, users who have docked at the EMX -BUSD farm can only claim their farm rewards every 12 hours. You can check the lockout period for each farm within the product session itself.
