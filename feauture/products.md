Our innovative model, in addition to having all existing products and services, whether on an Exchange or on a DEX, will allow more people to access this market in a simplified and agile way.

As it is a decentralized broker, the agility and reduction of bureaucracy in a series of processes will ensure that more people can adhere to this proposal, as there will be no need for third parties to manage the individual capital, which also implies the reduction of some fees, making the Equilibrium Dex a cheaper option too.

By designing a fully decentralized trading and exchange platform, it becomes possible a broad and clear participation for users with the aim of adapting the future of Equilibrium Dex. The main idea of the project is to produce a protocol to educate customers, using current means to reward EHX holders, increasing the value of the token in the course of the process.
