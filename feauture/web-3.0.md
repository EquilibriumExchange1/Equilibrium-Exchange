# ðŸ“Š WEB 3.0

**Web 3.0: An internet that belongs to users**

Seen as the third generation of the internet, Web 3.0 is an online decentralized ecosystem based on blockchain technology. In other words, the services and online pages will be produced on an immutable computer network that will guarantee their functionality without censorship and restrictions by a single institution.

Despite being a new concept and with little consensus on its exact definition, there are common factors that everyone agrees about web 3.0:

**Decentralization**: Today, the websites and content that we see on the internet are hosted on centralized servers and controlled by a specific company. The concept of Web 3.0 decentralization would be made possible by blockchain technology, that is, the content in circulation would be stored in a chain of blocks that would not be controlled by a single member, but rather a network of computers interconnected with each other and responsible for maintenance. and security thereof. Therefore, a single institution would not be able to censor, limit or remove specific content, as it would not have full control over its storage.

In addition to the benefit of decentralization, the use of blockchain will facilitate the transfer of value through digital assets and enable users to actually own them through NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This new technology will make each digital asset unique and allow it to be registered in the name of the owner, who will be able to market his properties in the digital world.

**No need for authentication and greater privacy**: By operating in a decentralized environment, people will not need to register and provide personal information on the network. The connection will be made directly through mechanisms such as digital wallets which have identification addresses, but information about the owner will not be public, the user will determine what will be shared.

**Greater presence of Artificial Intelligence**: Web 3.0 promises a greater involvement of computers and robots in the network, which in turn, through machine learning and artificial intelligence, will be able to make content recommendations in a decentralized way and with greater precision than current vehicles.

Will greater computing power be needed? Web 3.0 enthusiasts say no. Even with the entire infrastructure being cloud-based, data processing will be done in a decentralized manner. With that in mind, we won't need a single supercomputer to operate all these new innovations.

**Examples of companies exploring Web 3.0:**

Meta (formerly Facebook): Recently filed several patents related to the metaverse, use of cryptocurrencies, and blockchain-related technologies.

Shopify: Exploring implementing NFTs and smart contracts on your platform.

Amazon: You will be able to accept payments through cryptocurrencies and explore possibilities with NFTs.

Coinbase: Cryptocurrency exchange.

Block (formerly Square): Explores various services related to crypto assets
