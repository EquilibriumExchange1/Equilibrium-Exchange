# ðŸ“Š Yeld Farming

Yield farming is the practice of betting or lending crypto assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. In short, yield farming protocols encourage liquidity providers (LP) to stake or lock their crypto assets in a smart contract-based liquidity pool. These incentives can be a percentage of transaction fees, interest from lenders, or a governance token. These returns are expressed as an annual percentage yield (APY). As more investors add funds to the related liquidity pool, the value of issued returns increases in value.

At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to deposit their holdings in smart contracts, which in turn provide rewards. More specifically, it is a process that allows you to earn fixed or variable interest by investing cryptocurrencies in a DeFi market.

With this, investors can increase their token numbers and maximize profits!
