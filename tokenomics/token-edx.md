# ðŸ’Ž Token EDX

Our EDX token is a real gem!

With wide usability within our platform, EDX was designed to meet the reward and liquidity demands within the Equilibrium Dex, as well as encourage its application in staking and farm mechanisms.

With a contract that passes security from its audit (check audit section) to its well-distributed token-economy (check tokenomics section), our token promotes greater turnover by arousing buying interest from the part of investors, as it has high usability on our platform.

With an enormous potential for appreciation through its burns and growth on the part of the platform, which is still in its embryonic phase, the token will also be indispensable to guarantee unique benefits and exclusive NFTs initially found only within the Equilibrium Dex
