# ðŸ’Ž Tokenomics

Our token economy was designed with the sole and exclusive objective of generating value for our currency through its reward and usability systems within the platform, as well as ensuring the sustainability not only of the currency, but also of the entire ecosystem in which it is inserted.

The main reason for this is to make our model increasingly attractive, not only for the robustness and innovation of our system, but also for the possibility of monetization offered by our token and transparency presented in our contract and tokenomics.
