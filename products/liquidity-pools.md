# ðŸ“Š Liquidity pools

Liquidity pools use algorithms called Automated Market Makers (AMM) to provide constant liquidity for trading. They are used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity and are widely used by DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges).

A single liquidity pool contains a pair of tokens and each pool creates a new market for that specific pair of tokens. The first depositor of the pool or liquidity provider sets the initial price of the assets in the pool. Liquidity providers are encouraged to provide an equal value of both tokens to the pool. They receive special tokens called LP tokens in proportion to their contribution to the pool. When a trade takes place, a fee is collected and distributed proportionally to all LP token holders, and this fee changes from DEX to DEX.

When an exchange of tokens takes place through a pool, the supply of one asset decreases while that of the other increases. Therefore, price changes occur which are adjusted by this algorithm called automated market maker (AMM) discussed earlier. This is the time when liquidity pools play their best role as they do not need a professional, centralized market maker to manage asset prices. Liquidity providers simply deposit their assets into the pool and the smart contract takes care of pricing.

In short, when lending assets to generate liquidity within AlphaDEX, the user receives tokens as a form of reward, which makes pools an excellent alternative to obtain greater gains with cryptocurrencies within the market.
