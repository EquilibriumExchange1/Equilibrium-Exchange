**NFTs usage**

NFT cards will have multiple functions as well as multiple use cases on your platform! As the NFTs are tradable, in addition to being accessible, you will be able to trade our market without restriction, you will have a plan that will make it possible to include other projects in markets!

The NFTs are likely to be very appreciable for customers as they are considerably high. In addition to being a great instrument to make the EDX price stable, as NFTs have a decomposition period.

The Equilibrium Dex NFT feature is still holding many surprises for users! A document will soon be released in our system that will teach the step of how to use NFTs and the NFT Pool.
